# Privacy Policy for Context Carry

**Last Updated:** December 08, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Context Carry** ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, transfer, or share any of your personal data on remote servers.**

Context Carry is designed to function locally within your web browser.

- **No Remote Servers:** We do not operate any backend servers to process your conversations.
- **No Analytics:** We do not track your usage behavior or collect anonymous statistics.
- **Local Storage:** We use your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage`) solely to save your **user preferences** (such as your custom prompt templates). This data never leaves your device.

## 2. Permissions

To function correctly, Context Carry requires specific permissions in your browser. Here is an explanation of why each permission is needed:

* **`activeTab`**: This allows the extension to interact with the current tab when you click the extension icon. It is used to identify if you are on a supported AI platform.
* **`scripting`**: This is required to inject the content script into the webpage. This script creates the user interface (the buttons and panel) that allows you to select and copy text.
* **Host Permissions**: We request access to specific domains (`chatgpt.com`, `claude.ai`, `gemini.google.com`, `grok.com`) solely to enable the functionality of selecting and copying text from these sites.

## 3. Data Handling

When you use the "Transfer" or "Download" features:

1. The text you select is temporarily processed in your browser's memory (RAM) to format it for the clipboard or a text file.
2. This processing happens entirely on your device.
3. Once the action is complete, the temporary data is cleared from memory.
4. User settings (like custom titles) are stored locally in your browser and are not shared with us or third parties.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
